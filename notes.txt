First pass involved generating some basic stats (mean, std) per image, and training a Random Forest (RF) model with each unique class as the target vector.
Objective score from Kaggle was ~.75

Scripts:
calc_basic_stats.py

21/04/2017
Added power spectra mean+std and counts of features in each image band (ORB, SIFT, SURF) to the RF xvector
Objective score ~.83

Scripts:
calc_fft.py
calc_feats.py

22/04/2017
Added flattened haralick features (14/per direction/per channel) and added to the xvector and into RF xvector
Objective score ~.83

Trained first basic CNN overnight. Probabilities of tags were converted to tags using an arbitrary threshold (.2)
Objective score = .85
